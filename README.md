# ![Logo](images/logo.png) AntiPasteJacking 
*[AntiPasteJacking] is a Chrome extension to prevent the
[“pastejacking” exploit](https://github.com/dxa4481/Pastejacking). 
Pastejacking attack allows a [malicious website](https://security.love/Pastejacking/)
(this is a proof of concept) to copy arbitrary content to your clipboard. The
extension mitigates this threat by overriding document.execCommand and disable COPY and CUT commands.*
